In this website there are some features like the existing sales website, but the difference on this website is the existence of a member affiliate system that allows customers to become affiliates and earn additional income by buying and distributing certain products in the hope of increasing the number of permanent customers on al-makkiyah.com.</p><p style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Al-Makkiyah is an enterprise user of Merchant.id that allows al-makkiyah to use all the features of the dashboard that Merchant.id has. One of the most important of them is omni.merchant.id. Al-Makkiyah manages all the orders that have been obtained from al-makkiyah.com through omni.merchant.id. In the creation of al-makkiyah.com we spent about 3 months starting from the initial configuration until finally al-makkikiyah.com began to operate fully. al-makkiyah.com was built with the tech stack Svelte Framework, jQuery, Native CSS + Bootstrap v4.6, and Custom PHP Laravel Frameworks.</p><p style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the development process of al-makkiyah.com, I was assisted by a colleague at PT. Codelaris Inti Sinergi. During the development process I worked more with the UI/UX and Backend Developer team. From the beginning of the creation of al-makkiyah.com, the UI/UX team prepared design mockups in Figma. After the mockup is done for all pages, at that point I began to do slicing design from Figma to Svelte. And that&#39;s how the process of crafting continues until page by page is complete and correctly in accordance with the initial planning of construction. Not to forget that after the entire website was successfully built, the Tester team tested al-makkiyah.com. If at the time of testing a bug has been detected, then the bug will be immediately reported to the developer team for immediate correction and so on until the testing process does not find a bug at all.</p><p style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hardest challenge in making al-makkiyah.com was when I was already processing the data integration of the Backend Developer team, where sometimes there was an impediment on the API that had been made by Backend Developers which resulted in me having to wait for the backend developer team in the process of revision of the impediment until the mentioned impediment was properly overcome.</p><p style='text-align:justify'>So yeah, that&#39;s the process in the making of almakkiyah.com</p>"

You can see more about the Merchant Apps project <a href='http://portfolio-bagasfa.web.app/portfolio/merchant-apps' target='_blank'>here</a>. This landingpage was built using only HTML, CSS, and Javascript because this landingpage does not require dynamic data and is more concerned with the beauty of the interface design for potential customers and customers to be interested in Merchant.id ecosystem products. The process of making this landingpage only takes approximately 3 days because it only uses the tech stack mentioned earlier.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This landingpage has actually been around since 2019, but this landingpage needs a refreshed look to make it more attractive to potential customers to use the Merchant.id ecosystem. And finally a total refresh of the landingpage appearance was carried out in 2021, at which time I was in charge of refreshing the appearance of this landingpage interface. Before executing the refresh task, I waited for the UI/UX team to complete the latest mockup design of this landingpage and after that I sliced the design from Figma into a form of code very comfortably and really enjoyed the process. Besides that, I also did personal research about landingpage landingpage that is out there, then I took some ideas from the research process, one of the ideas that I poured on this landingpage is to add scrolling animation so that the landingpage looks more interactive in the eyes of the user and improve some typography that has been made by the UI / UX team to be more attractive in the eyes of the user. Of course, I don&#39;t forget to ask permission from the UI / UX team to avoid miscommunication why some components / designs are different from what they have previously designed in Figma.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s about the history of the creation and function of this landingpage, as always thank you for those of you who have taken the time to read the origin of the merchant.id landingpage.<br />You can also visit the merchant.id landingpage directly <a href='http://merchant.id' target='_blank'>here</a></p>"
